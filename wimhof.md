This is incomplete, but here as a starting point so I have somewhere to put my thoughts.

What I'm doing: wim hof
When I'm doing it

# Tips:
Don't stand up right away when you're done, sit first for a bit and then stand.
Don't forget the 15-20s breath hold after inhalation following extended breath hold. I tried to remember that and failed to do so during any of the three cycles.

DAY 1
=====

Noon

# Timings
First 30 inhalations: 4m 48s
First breath hold: 2m 3s
Second 30 inhalations: 4m 48s
Second breath hold: 1m 49s

# I think I failed to press the lap timer button during the third inhalation set
Combined third inhalations and breath hold: 6m 25s (assume 4:48 + 1:47)

Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 42s

Total time: 24m 36s

# Thoughts:
"My hands feel like catcher's mitts" (during third inhalation set)

DAY 2
=====

Noon

Forgot to hold breath between inhalations 2 and 3

First 30 inhalations: 3m 33s
First breath hold: 1m 41s
Pause, inhale and hold: 23s
Next 60 inhalations : 7m 44s
Towards the end, noticing the same "hard buzzing" in my hands, not painful. Also felt some of the same buzzing in my lips and mouth.
Kept checking to see if my hands were sweaty since it felt that way, but they were not; they were cold and dry.
Second breath hold: 1m 37s
Pause, inhale and hold: 20s
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 54s

Total time: 20m 16s

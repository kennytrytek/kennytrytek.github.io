# The Wim Hof Method
Hello! I am experimenting with the breathing techniques popularized most recently by Wim Hof. This page documents my experience and thoughts about it. I started doing this after a couple of my co-workers mentioned his books; I don't have any particular goal other than to see if it is beneficial or harmful for me.

### The Conditions Under Which This Is Performed


### Tips:
- Don't stand up right away when you're done, sit first for a bit and then stand.

# DAY 1
-------
## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 4m 48s  
First breath hold: 2m 3s  
Second 30 inhalations: 4m 48s  
Second breath hold: 1m 49s  
_I think I failed to press the lap timer button_  
Combined third inhalations and breath hold: 6m 25s (assume 4:48 + 1:47)  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 42s  
  
Total time: 24m 36s

### Thoughts:
- "My hands feel like catcher's mitts" (during third inhalation set). It's a "hard buzzing" feeling, not numbness or pins and needles, but a rushing buzz in my hands.
- I forgot to do a short inhale and pause after the breath holds. Whoops...

# DAY 2
-------
## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 3m 33s  
First breath hold: 1m 41s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 23s  
_Accidentally did a double inhalation set here without a breath hold_  
Next 60 inhalations : 7m 44s  
Second breath hold: 1m 37s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 20s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 54s  
  
Total time: 20m 16s  

### Thoughts:
- Towards the end, noticing the same "hard buzzing" in my hands, not painful. Also felt some of the same buzzing in my lips and mouth.
- I kept checking to see if my hands were sweaty since it felt that way, but they were not; they were cold and dry.

# DAY 3
-------
## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 3m 31s  
First breath hold: 1m 47s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 21s  
Second 30 inhalations : 3m 54s  
Second breath hold: 1m 43s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 23s  
Third 30 inhalations : 6m 39s  
Third breath hold: 1m 45s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 26s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 38s  
  
Total time: 25m 7s  

### Thoughts
- Wow, I must have lost count or something during the third cycle. This whole process gets pretty disorienting after a while.
- I'm more aware at other times of how I am breathing; the difference between the belly-breath and chest-breath will drift into my consciousness when I'm just sitting doing something else and sometimes I'll take a deeper breath than I would have before.

# DAY 4
-------

## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 3m 37s  
First breath hold: 1m 42s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 21s  
Second 30 inhalations : 6m 14s  
Second breath hold: 1m 54s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 26s  
Third 30 inhalations : 5m 03s  
Third breath hold: 2m 08s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 36s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 45s  
  
Total time: 26m 49s  

### Thoughts
- Wow, I don't know why the inhalation times have started to increase so dramatically after the first round. I don't think I'm fainting, but maybe I'm just becoming more relaxed and establishing a slower natural rhythm.
- One thing I notice is some lower groin pain on the right side; I think I might be overdoing the deep belly breath a little, so I'll try to hold back a bit there tomorrow.

# DAY 5
-------

## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 4m 34s  
First breath hold: 1m 47s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 23s  
Second 30 inhalations : 2m 11s  
Second breath hold: 1m 42s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 28s  
Third 30 inhalations : 4m 20s  
Third breath hold: 1m 25s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 30s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 6m 12s  
  
Total time: 23m 50s

### Thoughts
- Probably shorted myself on the second cycle, only 20-ish inhalations
- Timings might be off on this one, particularly after the second breath-hold. I have found that my hands want to curl closed during this exercise, and my left hand pressed the lap timer six extra times during the third cycle of inhalations and breath hold. I think to mitigate that I'll focus on keeping my left thumb pressed against the side of my hand until it's time to press the button, or maybe buy a stopwatch where it will require more force to press instead of using my phone, or I could set the phone on the floor instead of touching it.
- I've started moving my laptop to the floor and playing 30 minutes of meditative music from [brain.fm] so when I'm finished I can sit on the floor and type in my notes. The location of the laptop off the desk on the floor acts as a physical cue to take my time getting up and sit for a little bit while the music finishes.

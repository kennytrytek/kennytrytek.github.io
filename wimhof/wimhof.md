# The Wim Hof Method
Hello! I am experimenting with the breathing techniques popularized most recently by Wim Hof. This page documents my experience and thoughts about it. I started doing this after a couple of my co-workers mentioned his books; I don't have any particular goal other than to see if I can notice any effects from it.

### The Conditions Under Which This Is Performed
TODO

### Tips:
- Don't stand up right away when you're done, sit first for a bit and then stand.
- After each inhalation, audibly say the breath number after you release it. This will help considerably with producing a consistent experience, since it can otherwise be rather disorienting.

# DAY 1
-------
## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 4m 48s  
First breath hold: 2m 3s  
Second 30 inhalations: 4m 48s  
Second breath hold: 1m 49s  
_I think I failed to press the lap timer button_  
Combined third inhalations and breath hold: 6m 25s (assume 4:48 + 1:47)  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 42s  
  
Total time: 24m 36s

### Thoughts:
- "My hands feel like catcher's mitts" (during third inhalation set). It's a "hard buzzing" feeling, not numbness or pins and needles, but a rushing buzz in my hands.
- I forgot to do a short inhale and pause after the breath holds. Whoops...

# DAY 2
-------
## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 3m 33s  
First breath hold: 1m 41s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 23s  
_Accidentally did a double inhalation set here without a breath hold_  
Next 60 inhalations : 7m 44s  
Second breath hold: 1m 37s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 20s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 54s  
  
Total time: 20m 16s  

### Thoughts:
- Towards the end, noticing the same "hard buzzing" in my hands, not painful. Also felt some of the same buzzing in my lips and mouth.
- I kept checking to see if my hands were sweaty since it felt that way, but they were not; they were cold and dry.

# DAY 3
-------
## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 3m 31s  
First breath hold: 1m 47s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 21s  
Second 30 inhalations : 3m 54s  
Second breath hold: 1m 43s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 23s  
Third 30 inhalations : 6m 39s  
Third breath hold: 1m 45s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 26s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 38s  
  
Total time: 25m 7s  

### Thoughts
- Wow, I must have lost count or something during the third cycle. This whole process gets pretty disorienting after a while.
- I'm more aware at other times of how I am breathing; the difference between the belly-breath and chest-breath will drift into my consciousness when I'm just sitting doing something else and sometimes I'll take a deeper breath than I would have before.

# DAY 4
-------

## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 3m 37s  
First breath hold: 1m 42s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 21s  
Second 30 inhalations : 6m 14s  
Second breath hold: 1m 54s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 26s  
Third 30 inhalations : 5m 03s  
Third breath hold: 2m 08s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 36s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 45s  
  
Total time: 26m 49s  

### Thoughts
- Wow, I don't know why the inhalation times have started to increase so dramatically after the first round. I don't think I'm fainting, but maybe I'm just becoming more relaxed and establishing a slower natural rhythm.
- One thing I notice is some lower groin pain on the right side; I think I might be overdoing the deep belly breath a little, so I'll try to hold back a bit there tomorrow.

# DAY 5
-------

## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 4m 34s  
First breath hold: 1m 47s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 23s  
Second 30 inhalations : 2m 11s  
Second breath hold: 1m 42s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 28s  
Third 30 inhalations : 4m 20s  
Third breath hold: 1m 25s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 30s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 6m 12s  
  
Total time: 23m 50s

### Thoughts
- Probably shorted myself on the second cycle, only 20-ish inhalations
- Timings might be off on this one, particularly after the second breath-hold. I have found that my hands want to curl closed during this exercise, and my left hand pressed the lap timer six extra times during the third cycle of inhalations and breath hold. I think to mitigate that I'll focus on keeping my left thumb pressed against the side of my hand until it's time to press the button, or maybe buy a stopwatch where it will require more force to press instead of using my phone, or I could set the phone on the floor instead of touching it.
- I've started moving my laptop to the floor and playing 30 minutes of meditative music from [brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm) so when I'm finished I can sit on the floor and type in my notes. The location of the laptop off the desk on the floor acts as a physical cue to take my time getting up and sit for a little bit while the music finishes.

# DAY 6
-------

## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 3m 54s  
First breath hold: 1m 40s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 28s  
Second 30 inhalations : 4m 21s  
Second breath hold: 1m 45s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 26s  
Third 30 inhalations : 2m 35s  
Third breath hold: 1m 43s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 16s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 50s  
  
Total time: 22m 0s

### Thoughts
- The third cycle was shorter time on inhalations because I started saying the number of the inhalations out loud on the exhale. It is _a STRUGGLE_ to keep track of how many inhalations I've done. I was maybe a bit aggressive on keeping a fast pace here.
- I'll keep trying breathing out audibly the number of the inhalation and see if that helps make timings more consistent or at least helps me to know for sure how many breaths I'm taking.
- On the first two breath holds, I'm not trying to struggle to hold as long as I can, but on the third one I'm making a little more effort to fight the urge to breathe. As you can see from the timings, the faster third inhalation cycle didn't allow as much oxygen to get as deeply into my system so the breath hold there isn't any longer than the first two.

# DAY 7
-------

## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 2m 45s  
First breath hold: 1m 41s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 28s  
Second 30 inhalations : 3m 04s  
Second breath hold: 1m 50s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 28s  
Third 30 inhalations : 2m 48s  
Third breath hold: 1m 45s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 38s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 08s  
  
Total time: 19m 37s

### Thoughts
- I finally did it! 30 inhalations each cycle, paused after each breath hold, AND had the right number of button presses on the timer! Audibly exhaling the number of the breath kept my mind more engaged with the process and helped make it less disorienting.
- I didn't breathe as intensely today, and the hard buzzing in my hands was less than it has been. I think I can go a bit deeper on the belly breath without hurting myself.
- During the cycles, I keep my eyes closed; after finishing them, I keep my eyes open and stare at the ceiling while waiting for my hands to stop tingling. I don't know if there is any significance to that or not.

# DAY 8
-------

## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 2m 46s  
First breath hold: 1m 30s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 24s  
Second 30 inhalations : 3m 12s  
Second breath hold: 1m 45s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 21s  
Third 35 inhalations : 3m 37s  
Third breath hold: 1m 58s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 25s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 20s  
  
Total time: 20m 21s

### Thoughts
- Nice, this is a lot more consistent. After each inhalation and release, I'm audibly saying the breath count; it really helps keep things on track.
- I'm going to experiment with the number of inhalations per cycle. I'm thinking 30, 35, 40 will be a good way to achieve a deeper effect. I was previously probably unintentionally getting up to 40 or 50 inhalations before, so it will be interesting to see how much I can control the intensity of the effects.

# DAY 9
-------

## Noon
### Timings
First 30 inhalations: 2m 52s  
First breath hold: 1m 24s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 24s  
Second 35 inhalations : 3m 23s  
Second breath hold: 1m 47s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 24s  
Third 40 inhalations : 3m 53s  
Third breath hold: 2m 6s  
Pause, inhale and hold: 23s  
Relax until hands stop tingling: 4m 30s  
  
Total time: 21m 08s

### Thoughts
- Increased inhalations by five each cycle; I like that progression, it feels controlled.
- Felt the "hard buzzing" in my hands more intensely at the end of the third cycle. Number of inhalations appears to be the controlling factor there.
- If I were to add a fourth cycle, I'm not sure if I would do 40 or 45 inhalations. I'm enjoying the convenience of the 30-minute timing of the three cycles right now though, since it takes me just under ten minutes to type up my thoughts each day.
